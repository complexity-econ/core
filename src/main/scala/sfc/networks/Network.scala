/** Graph generation algorithms for agent interaction networks.
  *
  * Used in two contexts:
  *   - '''Firm supply-chain network''' (FirmInit) — topology governs technology
  *     diffusion and input-output linkages. Topology selected by env var
  *     `NETWORK_TOPOLOGY` (ws/er/ba/lattice), parameterized by `NETWORK_K`
  *     (degree) and `NETWORK_REWIRE_P` (WS only).
  *   - '''Household social network''' (Household.initVector) — Watts-Strogatz
  *     small-world graph governing consumption peer effects and social
  *     learning. Parameterized by `HH_SOCIAL_K` and `HH_SOCIAL_P`.
  *
  * All generators return undirected graphs as adjacency lists:
  * `Array[Array[Int]]` where `result(i)` contains the neighbor indices of node
  * `i`. Adjacency is always symmetric (i∈adj(j) ⟺ j∈adj(i)) and self-loop free.

    * is a regular lattice with high clustering; at p=1 it approaches a random
