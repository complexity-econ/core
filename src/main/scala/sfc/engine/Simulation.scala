/** Top-level orchestrator of the SFC-ABM simulation.
  *
  * Each call to `step` transforms the current state into the next state by
  * executing a fixed 10-stage pipeline that mirrors the real-world sequence of
  * economic decisions. The caller (Main.runSingle) invokes `step` in a monthly
  * loop, but `step` itself is time-agnostic — it only sees the current state:
  *
  *   - s1 FiscalConstraintStep — fiscal rules, minimum wage, lending base rate
  *   - s2 LaborDemographicsStep — labor market clearing, wages, demographics,
  *     ZUS/PPK
  *   - s3 HouseholdIncomeStep — HH income, consumption, PIT, sectoral mobility
  *   - s4 DemandStep — per-sector demand multipliers, aggregate demand
  *   - s5 FirmProcessingStep — production, I-O, technology adoption, loans, NPL
  *   - s6 HouseholdFinancialStep — mortgages, consumer credit, remittances,
  *     tourism
  *   - s7 PriceEquityStep — inflation, price level, GPW equity market, sigma
  *     dynamics
  *   - s8 OpenEconomyStep — BoP, forex, GVC trade, monetary policy, bonds, QE,
  *     NBFI
  *   - s9 BankUpdateStep — bank P&L, provisioning, CAR, interbank, deposit
  *     rates
  *   - s10 WorldAssemblyStep — assemble new World + SFC validation (14
  *     identities)
  *
  * The pipeline is strictly sequential: each step's Input case class carries
  * typed references to all prior step Outputs it needs (e.g. s7 receives
  * s1–s5). This makes data dependencies explicit at the type level and
  * eliminates the field-unpacking boilerplate that would otherwise dominate the
  * orchestrator.
  *
  * The final step (s10) assembles the updated World, reassigns households to
  * firms, and runs the SFC accounting check (see Sfc.validate). If any of the
  * 14 balance-sheet identities is violated, the check returns Left with
  * detailed error information — the simulation halts immediately in Main.
  *
  * No business logic lives here — every calculation is delegated to a Step
  * object in the `steps` package. This file is pure wiring.
  *
  * When to modify this file:
  *   - Adding a new pipeline stage: insert a new sN call and thread its Output
  *     to downstream steps that need it.
  *   - Adding a new field to an existing Step's Input: no change here — the
  *     Step's Input already receives the full Output objects.
  *   - Changing step ordering: reorder the sN calls (rare — ordering reflects
  *     real-world causality).

  *   [[sfc.accounting.Sfc]] — the 14 SFC identities and MonthlyFlows
