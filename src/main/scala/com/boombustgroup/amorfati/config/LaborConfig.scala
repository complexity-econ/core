/** Labor market: sectoral mobility, trade unions, and forward-looking
  * expectations.
  *
  * Three interacting mechanisms: (1) sectoral labor mobility with friction
  * matrix (GUS LFS 2024, Shimer 2005), (2) trade unions with per-sector
  * density, wage premia, and downward rigidity (GUS 2024), and (3)
  * forward-looking inflation/wage expectations with adaptive learning and
  * central bank credibility (Carroll 2003, Bewley 1999, NBP target band).
  *
  * @param frictionMatrix
  *   sector-to-sector transition friction matrix (6x6, higher = harder to move)
  * @param frictionDurationMult
  *   multiplier on transition duration (scales friction matrix)
  * @param frictionCostMult
  *   wage penalty during sectoral transition (fraction of wage lost)
  * @param voluntarySearchProb
  *   monthly probability of employed worker searching for better sector
  * @param voluntaryWageThreshold
  *   minimum wage gap (fraction) to trigger voluntary search
  * @param vacancyWeight
  *   weight of vacancy rate in sectoral attractiveness
  * @param adjacentFrictionMax
  *   maximum friction for adjacent sectors (caps transition difficulty)
  * @param unionDensity
  *   per-sector union membership density (6 sectors, GUS 2024)
  * @param unionWagePremium
  *   wage premium for unionized workers (empirical: ~8%)
  * @param unionRigidity
  *   downward nominal wage rigidity imposed by unions (0-1 scale)
  * @param expLambda
  *   adaptive learning rate for inflation expectations (Carroll 2003)
  * @param expCredibilityInit
  *   initial central bank credibility (0-1 scale)
  * @param expCredibilitySpeed
  *   monthly credibility adjustment speed
  * @param expCredibilityThreshold
  *   inflation deviation threshold for credibility loss (pp)
  * @param expWagePassthrough
  *   pass-through of inflation expectations to wage demands
  * @param expBondSensitivity
  *   sensitivity of bond yields to inflation expectations
